# Execution Layer(EL)

The Spicenet Execution Layer is at the core of Spicenet's processing power. Also called as the runtime, it is a collection of components that allows execution of transactions, state commitments, and interfacing with the DA layer. The runtime has two major goals, to allow scalable execution of transactions and overcome traditional state commitment overheads. We will split our discussions about the runtime into two parts

* Sequential vs Parallel Execution: Our current state
* Virtual Machine: Why Spicenet does not feature a Virtual Machine
