# Technical Discussion

The technical discussion surrounding SpiceNet is divided into several major areas:

* [NOMT: Nearly Optimal Merkle Trees to solve state access bottlenecks.](nearly-optimal-merkle-tree.md)
* [Deterministic STF and Sequencer: Deterministic state updates allowing for least downtine.](deterministic-stf-and-sequencer.md)
* [Preferred and Based Sequencing: The secret sauce behind instant pre-confirmation, along with sequencer downtime protections.](preferred-and-based-sequencing.md)
* Optimistic vs ZK: What and Why?
* Execution Layer
  * Sequential execution spec
  * Virtual Machine considerations
* DA Layer Considerations
