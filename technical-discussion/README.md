# Technical Discussion

The technical discussion surrounding SpiceNet is divided into several major areas:

* [NOMT: Nearly Optimal Merkle Trees to solve state access bottlenecks.](nearly-optimal-merkle-tree.md)
* [Deterministic STF and Sequencer: Deterministic state updates allowing for least downtine.](deterministic-stf-and-sequencer.md)
* [Preferred and Based Sequencing: The secret sauce behind instant pre-confirmation, along with sequencer downtime protections.](preferred-and-based-sequencing.md)
* [Optimistic vs ZK: What and Why?](optimistic-vs-zk-what-and-why.md)
* [Execution Layer](execution-layer-el/)
  * [Sequential execution spec](execution-layer-el/sequential-execution-our-current-state.md)
  * [Virtual Machine considerations](execution-layer-el/why-spicenet-does-not-have-a-vm.md)
* [DA Layer Considerations](da-layer-considerations.md)
